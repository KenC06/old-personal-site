      <h3>Python programming</h3>
      <p>I am a python <span class="underlined italicize">pro</span> grammer (get it!?).
          Python is the first programming language I learned, and I believe I am quite proficient in it for a 14 year old.
          I have made a few scripts and games which you can check out on my github (which I have linked below)
          when I upload them.

      <h3>iOS App Developing</h3>
      <p>I have made several apps for iOS using Swift, which is my favourite programming language.
          I mainly make apps as solutions to annoyances that occur daily in my life.

      <h3>Web Developing</h3>
      <p>Despite me not knowing a lot of HTML and CSS, I have made some personal websites, including this one.
          I believe that I have done a good job, but I trust you to be the judge of that.

        <h3>Singing</h3>
        <p> There is seldom a day where I haven't randomly burst into song, which I believe annoys my family.
            Despite this, my friends say that their ears cannot bear my angelic voice and refuse to listen when I
            <span class="strike-through">scream</span> sing.
            I have taken this as a sign that I am doing something right, and have started to sing more frequently now. (To my friends dismay)
